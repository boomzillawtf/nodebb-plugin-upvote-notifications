# NodeBB Filter Upvotes Plugin

The Filter Upvotes Plugin allows users to customize the way NodeBB notifies them of
upvotes to their posts:

 - All: Default. Users get notified of all upvotes.
 - 1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, x50: Users get notifications at certain milestones
 - First Only: Only the first upvote generates a notification.
 - None: The user never gets any upvote notifications.

## Developers
In order to run tests, nodebb must be installed as a module via npm link (the package in npm is very old).
First, go to your nodebb directory, then:
`$ sudo npm link`

Next, from this plugin's root directory:
`$ npm link`
